# Form Validation

This is a simple form validation script built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides real-time validation for a user registration form, ensuring that users provide correct and complete information before submission.

## Form Validation Refactoring
This folder contains two JavaScript files, app.js and app1.js, both of which provide form validation functionality with the same output. However, app1.js contains refactored code for improved readability, maintainability, or performance.

## Features

- **Real-Time Validation:** Validate form fields as users type to provide immediate feedback on errors.
- **Field Requirements:** Display error messages for fields that are required, invalid, or do not meet specified criteria.
- **Password Matching:** Check if the password and confirm password fields match.
- **Field Length Check:** Ensure that fields such as username and password meet minimum and maximum length requirements.
- **Email Validation:** Validate email addresses to ensure they are in the correct format.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.
2. Fill out the form fields with the required information.
3. As you type, error messages will appear if there are any issues with the input.
4. Ensure all error messages are resolved before submitting the form.

## Development

This form validation script was developed using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No external libraries or frameworks were used, making it lightweight and easy to integrate into any web project.
